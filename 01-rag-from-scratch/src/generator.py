# STEP 6 OF THE RAG PIPELINE: GENERATING THE ANSWER WITH AN LLM
#
# WHAT DOES RetrievalQA DO?
# --------------------------
# RetrievalQA is a LangChain "chain" that combines two things:
#   1. A retriever (which fetches relevant chunks from FAISS)
#   2. An LLM (which reads those chunks and generates an answer)
#
# It handles the "stuffing" step: it takes the retrieved Document objects,
# extracts their page_content, concatenates them into a {context} block,
# and injects that into our prompt template before calling the LLM.
#
# WHY THE "ONLY USE CONTEXT" INSTRUCTION PREVENTS HALLUCINATION:
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# LLMs are trained on massive datasets and have general knowledge baked in.
# Without explicit instructions, an LLM might answer from its training data
# instead of your documents — which defeats the entire purpose of RAG.
#
# The system instruction "answer ONLY based on the following context" tells
# the LLM to restrict itself to what we provide. The fallback phrase
# "I don't know based on the provided documents" prevents the LLM from
# making things up when the answer truly isn't in the documents.
#
# This is the most important prompt engineering technique in RAG systems.
#
# WHAT IS THE SYSTEM PROMPT PATTERN?
# ------------------------------------
# A "prompt template" is a string with placeholder variables (like {context}
# and {question}) that get filled in at runtime. This lets us:
#   - Set the LLM's behavior with clear instructions at the top
#   - Inject the retrieved context dynamically for each query
#   - Ask the user's question at the end
#
# The resulting filled-in prompt is what actually gets sent to the LLM API.
# With debug=True, you can print this full prompt to see exactly what the LLM receives.

# The prompt template instructs the LLM to stay grounded in the provided context.
# {context} will be replaced by the retrieved chunks (as a single text block).
# {question} will be replaced by the user's question.

    Build a RetrievalQA chain that combines document retrieval with LLM generation.

    This is the final assembly step of the RAG pipeline:
        User question
            → retriever fetches top-k relevant chunks from FAISS
            → chunks are injected into the prompt template as {context}
            → LLM reads context + question and generates a grounded answer

    Args:
        retriever:          A LangChain retriever (from retriever.py).
        model_name (str):   LLM to use. Options:
                              - "gpt-3.5-turbo"   (OpenAI, requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
                              - "gpt-4"            (OpenAI, more powerful, costs more)
                              - "ollama/llama3"    (local Ollama, no API key needed)
                              - "ollama/mistral"   (local Ollama, no API key needed)
        debug (bool):       If True, prints the full prompt sent to the LLM.
                            Useful for understanding what the LLM actually receives.

    Returns:
        RetrievalQA: A runnable chain. Call chain.invoke({"query": "your question"})
                     to get an answer dict with keys "query", "result", "source_documents".

    Example:
        chain = build_qa_chain(retriever, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", debug=True)
        result = chain.invoke({"query": "What is the refund policy?"})
        print(result["result"])
